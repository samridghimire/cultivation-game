## Entries
- 2026-10-07: baseline set by the owner's session after the switch to planner/worker/reviewer. Main green (890 tests).
- 2026-10-07 (reviewer): reviewed b71190a..94480a0 (1396d1e agent team v2, 5a96250 C-005b, 94480a0 FH-001; [PLAN] commits skipped).
  Main green (890 tests). No BACKLOG/CHANGELOG edits by workers; no save-format changes.
  - C-005b: data valid and wired (deed_context on Peddler Hei, max_alignment deed gate supported). Bug: Blood Lotus Scout's
    kill reward was alignment -5 while every other Blood Lotus foe rewards positive alignment. Fixed to +10.
  - FH-001: matches spec (region id is `qingshi_village`, spec said `qingshi`; worker picked the right one). Bug: the
    "Use your <item>" newcomer hint could recommend a Blood Essence Pill (burns lifespan) or Blood Demon Pill (demonic).
    Fixed: harmful items (burn_lifespan or negative alignment) are skipped; test added. Spec step 4 (days-estimate
    wording) was optional and not done. Older saves lack `talked_elder_mo`, so the Elder Mo hint shows once more; harmless.
  - FH-004 (b7f586d, landed mid-review): matches spec, tests cover sense/flee/fight/Deadly/non-lethal. Note: until FH-004b
    adds the prompt, nothing answers `threat_sensed`, so lethal Dangerous foes met while exploring are effectively always
    skipped (pending_threat is cleared by the next explore). Only explore/encounter paths clear `pending_threat`; FH-004b's
    prompt should be modal so a stale threat can't be fought after travelling.
  - Fixed in one [REVIEW] commit; nothing filed. Main green (895+ tests).
- 2026-10-08 (reviewer): reviewed f313ee5..1cf2753 (FH-010, FH-011, QA-017, FH-002, FH-003, FH-004b, FH-015, FH-020, FH-005,
  FH-006, FH-012, FH-013, REL-001, QA-016, REL-002, FH-014, FH-021, FH-022, LW-002; [PLAN] commits skipped). Main green
  (947 tests). No BACKLOG/CHANGELOG edits by workers; no SAVE_VERSION change (FH-003's `deed_days` defaults to {}).
  - REL-002 bug (save loss): `SaveManager.current_slot` and the autosave were never reset between characters. Load
    character A from slot1, return to the menu, start a new character B: B's final death overwrote A's slot1 (and A's
    autosave) with a dead B. Fixed: SaveManager resets current_slot / autosave day on `session_started` (load_game sets
    the slot afterwards), and a final death only overwrites the autosave if this session wrote it or it holds a
    character of the same name. Test added. REL-002 had no test for the cross-character case.
  - FH-003, FH-004b, FH-002, LW-002, REL-001: match specs, tests present. LW-002 only reserves spouses/descendants from
    recruitment; other known NPCs (companions with favor) can be recruited, acceptable for part 1.
  - Fixed in one [REVIEW] commit; nothing filed.
