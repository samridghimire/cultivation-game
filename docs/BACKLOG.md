# Backlog

Work queue for agents, owned by the **planner** (see docs/AGENTS.md). Workers pick the top `todo` task for their role and never edit this file.
Status: `todo` (add `spec` when a detailed spec exists) | `done` | `blocked` (needs a human answer, link the question). A task is claimed while a branch `claude/<id>-*` exists.
Roles: `systems` (core rules + tests), `content` (data/*.json + small hooks), `world-ui` (scenes, UI, UX), `qa` (tests, bugs, balance).
Tables are in priority order: take the first unclaimed `todo` row for your role whose dependencies are on main.
Long specs live in docs/specs/<id>.md. Tasks finished before 2026-10-07 are in docs/BACKLOG_DONE.md.
Many leftover `claude/*` branches from the old PR flow point at tasks already done; they are not claims on any open task.

## P0: Playable and fun (the first hours)
Next (planner 2026-10-15 14:10): 17 tasks landed (RIVAL-005/006, FOUND-003, CHOICE-001, GUIDE-027/028, WU-132/136/137/140/141/142/143,
C-065, C-083, QA-072, QA-074). Systems and world-ui queues were empty; new work: **the rivalry keeps going** (RIVAL-007 surpass a
rival already behind, RIVAL-008 they push back, WU-148 the realm card names them, C-087 at Foundation, QA-078 measures it);
**the pill gap** (QA-072: 6 of 10 sim players now afford the Foundation pill; GUIDE-029 tells the rest how to earn the gap, QA-076
measures whether waiting closes it; the price stays the owner's F-005d call); **choices that use who you are** (CHOICE-002
profession checks + WU-146 "[Comprehension 12]" tags, C-088/C-090/C-091 data); **fights for rogues** (GUIDE-030 rates the
region's exploration foes, WU-147 bounties on the map); polish from Follow-ups (WU-144 shorter HUD line, WU-145 breakthrough
window at 720p, WU-149 lessons on a failed attempt); FOUND-004 goals after Foundation.
| id | role | status | task |
|---|---|---|---|
| RIVAL-007 | systems | todo spec | Surpassing a rival who is already behind (reviewer 18th run, note 1: RIVAL-006 only checks after your own breakthrough, so a rival a realm behind at the first meeting, or one who stalls while you sit at a bottleneck, is never "surpassed" until your next breakthrough). *Spec:* src/autoload/game_state.gd `_rival_news()` (~2959): after the `rival == null` return and after the SEEN_REALM bookkeeping (on both paths, including the first-time `return` branch: restructure so the seed-and-return does not skip it), call `_check_rival_surpassed()`. Nothing else changes: the flag makes it once-only, and `Rivals.surpassed` already needs the rival alive and below you. Tests (tests/unit/test_rivals.gd or test_game_session.gd, whichever holds RIVAL-006's GameState test): (1) rival met and already one realm below, advance one month (the path that runs `_rival_news`) -> `rival_surpassed` set and the line posted exactly once; a second month posts nothing; (2) rival equal -> nothing; (3) rival not yet met (`rival_met` unset) -> nothing. |
| CHOICE-002 | systems | todo spec | Encounter choices that need a profession, and say what they check (CHOICE-001's sibling; surfaces professions in the wilds). *Spec:* (1) src/core/systems/exploration.gd `check_choice` (~500): new `requires.min_profession: {"<profession id>": <rank int >= 1>}`; fails with "You need to be %s %s for that." (`data.profession_rank_names[rank]`, the profession's `name`, a/an via `Text.a` if the rank name needs it; read how `_profession_goal` in guidance.gd words ranks) when `Professions.rank_of(c, id) < rank`. (2) Validation next to CHOICE-001's (~577): unknown profession id or a rank < 1 or above `Professions.max_rank(data)` is an error. (3) `choices()` (~527) adds `"check": String` to every entry: "" when the choice has no attribute/profession requirement, else a short tag like "Comprehension 12" or "Doctor, Apprentice" (several joined by ", "); helper `static func check_tag(data, choice) -> String`. (4) Document `min_profession` and the `check` key in data/encounters.json `_doc` next to `min_attributes`. Tests (tests/unit/test_encounter_choices.gd): rank 0 doctor blocked with the reason, rank 1 allowed; validation catches an unknown id and rank 0; `check` is "" for a plain choice and names the attribute for a min_attributes choice. No data uses it yet (C-090). |
| GUIDE-029 | systems | todo spec | The pill gap says how to close it (QA-072 Follow-up: 3 of 10 sim players reach the Qi Refining bottleneck 130-190 stones short of the ~300-stone Foundation pill, and attempt anyway). *Spec:* (1) src/core/systems/guidance.gd `_rate_fight` (~1044): entries gain `"stones": int`: bounties `Bounties.paid_stones(c, data, b)` (pass it in from the bounty loop), missions and deeds the `spirit_stone` count in their reward/effects `items` if any, else 0. (2) New `static func pill_gap_note(c, data, fights: Array) -> String`: "" unless `pill_saving_goal(c, data)` != "" and stones < `next_realm_pill_price`; else "%d stones short. %s pays %d." naming the fair fight (from `fights`, i.e. fair_fights output) with the most `stones` > 0 (text = the entry's label part before " (", or simply the enemy name with its kind: "A bounty on the <enemy>"), or "%d stones short. Bounties, sect missions and selling herbs and ore pay best." when none pays. (3) Journal: in `journal()` compute `fair_fights` once and pass it to both `_fair_fight_entries` and `_breakthrough_entries` (or wherever the "Save for ..." line is shown in the journal), adding the note as its own line under the saving line, tone "normal". The HUD goals line stays as is (no combat sims there). Tests (test_guidance.gd): short with a fair 40-stone bounty in reach -> names it and 40; short with no paying fight -> the generic line; affordable -> ""; below 7th layer -> "". |
| RIVAL-008 | systems | todo | A rival who will not stay behind (after RIVAL-007). When the rival is surpassed, their pride drives them: `Rivals.spur(rival, data)` raises their `diligence` by data/karma.json `rival.spurred_diligence` (new, 0.1, capped at 0.95, validated 0-1, in the rival `_doc`), called from `_check_rival_surpassed`. If the rival later climbs back past you (`Rivals.relation` == "stronger" again, checked in `_rival_news`), clear `rival_surpassed` and post "%s has overtaken you again." (warning) so surpassing them can happen again (the milestone stays earned). Tests in test_rivals.gd: spur raises and caps diligence; overtaken clears the flag and posts once; surpass again posts the surpass line again. |
| GUIDE-030 | systems | todo | Fights you can win in the wilds (QA-070: bounties are listed ~3 times in 120 months, so for a rogue the journal and HUD fair-fight line are usually empty). In `Guidance.fair_fights`, when fewer than FAIR_FIGHTS_MAX entries were found, rate the current region's exploration foes: the enemies of fight encounters `Exploration` can roll here for this player now (reuse its own filtering: tags, realm gates, flags, season; read `roll_encounter` and extract a `static func eligible_fights(c, data, tags, flags, season, region_id) -> Array[String]` returning enemy ids if one does not exist), at most 2 rated, kind "explore", text "Explore here: %s (%s, %d in 100)". Count them in FAIR_FIGHT_MAX_RATED. Tests: a region with a fair exploration foe lists it when no mission/bounty is fair; missions still sort first at equal chance; lethal "Deadly" foes never listed (they are below 0.7 anyway). Re-run tests/sim/fair_fights.gd and paste the explore row win share. |
| FOUND-004 | systems | todo | Goals after Foundation (the journal's first goals end at the 3rd layer; after that only the realm/rank/milestone lines). Smallest version: `Guidance.foundation_goals(c, data, flags, clan) -> Array[Dictionary]` like `first_goals`, shown by the journal (and ticked by WU-131's banner, which keys off first goals: generalise it to both lists) only from Foundation Establishment until all are done: "Reach Foundation Establishment Middle", "Claim a cave abode" (`c.abode != ""`), "Temper your body to its first stage" (BodyTempering stage >= 1), "Win a fight against a Foundation foe" (a LifeStats counter if one exists; else `fights_won` gained since reaching Foundation via a stat recorded at the breakthrough), "Found a clan or rise to Inner Disciple" (clan != null or sect rank >= 2). Pick only goals whose state is already tracked; skip any that would need new persistent state and say so in Follow-ups. Tests in test_guidance.gd. |
| WU-144 | world-ui | todo spec | A shorter fair-fight line on the HUD (WU-132 Follow-up: with a long mission title the line ellipsizes at 14px). *Spec:* src/ui/hud.gd `fair_fight_line(entries)` (~552): return "Fair fight: %s (%s %d)" built from the first entry's `enemy` name, `Combat.label_for_chance(chance)` and `roundi(chance * 100)`; when `enemy` is "" fall back to today's text. Keep the full `text` of all listed entries (one per line) in the label's tooltip, as now. Update the HUD test that pins the old text (grep `fair_fight_line` in tests/). Re-run `--win-shots` (tests/sim/screenshot_screens.gd) at 1280x720 and say in the commit whether the line still ellipsizes. |
| WU-145 | world-ui | todo spec | The breakthrough window at 720p, everything in (WU-140 and WU-142 Follow-ups: the realm blurb, the stones-vs-pill line and the lessons line all add height; nobody checked Attempt / Not yet at 1280x720). *Spec:* add a `--breakthrough-shots` mode to tests/sim/screenshot_screens.gd (like `--win-shots`): open the breakthrough window for a Qi Refining 9th Layer player at full qi (a) with no pill and 120 stones, (b) holding a Foundation Establishment Pill, (c) with `breakthrough_failures` 3 (lessons line). Shoot each at 1280x800 and 1280x720. If any button or line is cut off, fix it in src/ui/breakthrough_screen.gd (wrap the terms in a ScrollContainer with a max height, or tighten spacing) keeping focus on Attempt. Add a test in tests/unit/test_breakthrough_screen.gd that at 1280x720 the Attempt and Not yet buttons lie inside the viewport (`get_global_rect()` within `get_viewport_rect()`) for case (b)+(c). Paste verdicts per shot in the commit. |
| WU-147 | world-ui | todo spec | Bounties on the world map (bounty boards exist in Qingshi and Fallen Star Market, but the map never says where a hunt is). *Spec:* src/ui/world_map_screen.gd `region_marks` (~208): (1) when `Bounties.active(c, data, total_days)` is not empty and its `region` == region_id, add `{"kind": "bounty", "text": "Your hunt: %s (%s left)" % [enemy name, Calendar.format_duration(days left)]}` (read Bounties.active / expire for the end day); (2) else, for each `Bounties.offers(c, data, total_days)` whose region == region_id and `check_take` == "", one mark "Bounty: %s, %d stones" (enemy name, `Bounties.paid_stones`), at most 2 per region. Add "bounty" to MARK_COLORS (reuse the danger or warning color from UIStyle) and to the legend if the map has one. Tests in tests/unit/test_world_map_screen.gd: active hunt marks its region only; an offer you cannot take (realm gate) is not marked; offers capped at 2. |
| WU-146 | world-ui | todo | Encounter choices show their check (after CHOICE-002). src/ui/encounter_window.gd `choice_label` (~35): an enabled choice with a non-empty `check` reads "[Comprehension 12] Answer better than ..." (accent color if the button supports it, else just the prefix); a disabled one keeps today's "(reason)" suffix. Test in test_encounter_window.gd for both. |
| WU-148 | world-ui | todo | The realm card names the rival you just passed. When a major breakthrough also surpasses the rival (RIVAL-006's line is posted in the same action), the RealmCard shows "You have surpassed <name>." as its first extra line (`card_lines` keeps MAX_EXTRA_LINES). Smallest wiring: GameState keeps `last_surpassed_rival: String` set in `_check_rival_surpassed` and cleared when the HUD opens the card (or on the next action); hud.gd passes it to the card. Test in test_realm_card.gd. |
| WU-149 | world-ui | todo | A failed breakthrough says what you learned (FOUND-003 shows lessons only in the next window's odds). In src/autoload/game_state.gd `attempt_breakthrough` (~317/319), after a failed major breakthrough append " The lessons stay with you: +%d percent on your next attempt." (or "...: your lessons are already worth all they can teach (+%d percent)." at `failure_bonus_max`), from `Cultivation.chance_breakdown`'s lessons term or the same min(); minor (layer) failures unchanged. Test in test_game_session.gd or test_breakthrough_news.gd with a seeded failing attempt. |
| C-085 | content | todo spec | Guard: every region with a Qi Refining fight has a Qi Refining bounty (C-081 Follow-up; it holds today: Qingshi, Misty Forest, Fallen Star Market, Azure Peak, Withered Bone Marsh). Add a data test (next to the bounty data test): for each region, if any encounter in data/encounters.json reachable there (match the region's encounter tags the way `Exploration` picks them; reuse its helper if one is static) has a fight and `min_realm` qi_refining (or none), at least one bounty in data/bounties.json for that region has `min_realm` qi_refining. If it fails for a region, add a bounty there in C-081's style (60-80% at its gate; paste the simulate_combat.gd row). |
| C-089 | content | todo spec | Help pages for your rival and failed breakthroughs (after RIVAL-005, RIVAL-006 and FOUND-003). Add a "Your rival" page (the first meeting, the journal line, the label and map mark, word of their breakthroughs, surpassing them) and extend the breakthrough page with the lessons of failed attempts (`failure_bonus` per failure up to the cap, reset on success; read the numbers from data/realms.json). Plain, short, second person, like C-070. Test: the help data test passes. |
| C-088 | content | todo spec | The lecture rewards a sharper answer (after CHOICE-001; C-086 Follow-up). Give C-086's sect-lecture rival encounter a choice "Answer better than {rival}" with `requires: {"min_attributes": {"comprehension": 12}}` and qi +60 plus `rival_favor` 5 (or the field C-086 used), keeping the plain choices for everyone else. Tests: the C-086 data test still passes; a test that the new choice is disabled at Comprehension 10 and allowed at 12 (`Exploration.check_choice`). |
| C-087 | content | todo spec | Your rival at Foundation (C-086 did the first year). data/encounters.json: 3 rival encounters gated `min_realm`/`max_realm` foundation_establishment with `requires_flag: rival_met`, once-only like C-086's: (1) Fallen Star Market, `rival: "stronger"`: {rival} bids against you for a Foundation-grade herb at a stall (let it go; pay 60 stones for 1 of the region's foundation herbs; walk away with a cold word, `rival_grudge` 5). (2) Myriad Peaks Ridge or Withered Bone Marsh, `rival: "weaker"`: {rival} is cornered by a beast and calls your name (save them: a fight against an existing Foundation enemy of that region, 55-75% at the gate, paste the simulate_combat.gd row, `rival_favor` 20; leave them: alignment -10). (3) Azure Peak, `rival: "equal"`: a sparring challenge before the sect (accept: `fight_rival` non-lethal as C-086's herb seller; decline: nothing). Genre voice of C-086. Tests: EFF-001's effect walk passes; extend C-086's data test to these three. |
| C-062 | content | todo | Requests for the renowned (after RENOWN-002). One `min_renown` encounter per region besides the two RENOWN-002 wrote (Fallen Star Market, Azure Peak, Withered Bone Marsh, Myriad Peaks Ridge), once-only, fitting the region (a guild master asks you to escort a shipment; an elder of a minor sect asks you to judge a duel; marsh villagers beg you to end a corpse refiner; a ridge beast clan asks for a truce), gated at the region's realm, rewards about a week of the region's gather income plus favor/renown; any fight 45-75% at its gate (paste simulate_combat.gd rows). Tests: data test that every region has a min_renown encounter. |
| C-090 | content | todo | Encounters a profession can answer (after CHOICE-002). Give 4 existing encounters (one per profession: doctor, alchemist, blacksmith, beast tamer; pick ones that already fit, e.g. a wounded traveller, a cracked cauldron, a broken blade, a sick spirit beast, across at least 3 regions) a choice with `requires.min_profession` rank 1, rewarding a little better than the best plain choice (some stones, favor, profession xp if Effects supports it, or `grateful_npc`). Genre voice. Tests: EFF-001's effect walk passes; a data test that each new choice is blocked at rank 0 and allowed at rank 1 (`Exploration.check_choice`). |
| C-091 | content | todo | More attribute checks in the first year (after CHOICE-001, like C-088). Give 4 existing Qi Refining encounters (not C-086's) a `min_attributes` choice, one each for Spirit, Fortune, Charisma and Constitution, at 12, rewarding modestly (qi 40-60, a herb, 20-40 stones, or favor). Check data/attributes.json for the starting range so 12 is reachable for ~a third of characters, and say so in the commit. Tests like C-088's. |

|---|---|---|---|

## P4: QA and tooling
| id | role | status | task |
|---|---|---|---|
| QA-076 | qa | todo spec | Can income close the pill gap? (QA-072 Follow-up: seeds 5, 8, 10 reach the bottleneck with 114-169 stones against ~300.) In tests/sim/first_hour.gd add a `--wait-for-pill=N` curious-policy option: at the bottleneck without the pill, keep earning (missions, bounties, chores, selling gathered goods) for up to N days (try 60 and 120) before attempting. Report per seed: days waited, stones at the attempt, pill bought (y/n), chance, result; medians against QA-072's section. Refresh docs/balance_baseline.txt with a new section; no data changes. If income cannot close it in 120 days, say so plainly in the commit (it feeds the owner's F-005d pacing question). |
| QA-077 | qa | todo spec | Paste the fair-fights bounty row (GUIDE-028 Follow-up: the before/after was not run). Re-run tests/sim/fair_fights.gd (seeds as QA-067), refresh its section of docs/balance_baseline.txt with bounties listed / taken / won vs rated, and note whether GUIDE-028 raised the listed count. |
| QA-078 | qa | todo | How the rivalry plays out (RIVAL-005/006 landed; input for RIVAL-008). New tests/sim/rival_story.gd (or a section in first_hour.gd): seeds 1-10, 36 months, default and curious policies: day of the first meeting, the rival's realm/stage every 6 months next to the player's, the day the player surpasses them (or never), rival breakthrough news lines posted, rival encounters met (C-086). Add a docs/balance_baseline.txt section. Flag if the rival is surpassed in under a year in most seeds (then the rival never feels like a threat). |
| QA-073 | qa | todo spec | tools/test.sh under 8 minutes (QA-068 Follow-up: the six fuzz profiles still total ~4 min of the 531 s unit suite). *Spec:* tests/unit/test_fuzz*.gd: build the aged world once per file (a static cached fixture created on first use, cloned per test if a test mutates it; `CharacterData.from_dict(to_dict())` is a cheap clone) instead of per method, and/or lower `MAX_CALLS_PER_NODE` for the non-mortal profiles while keeping every interactable kind visited at least once (assert it). Never drop a profile or an assertion. Paste the "Slowest tests" top 15 and the suite total before/after in the commit body. Goal: unit suite < 420 s. If PERF-001 has landed, say how much it contributed. |
| QA-071 | qa | todo spec | Refresh the early-inheritances baseline (reviewer note: QA-064's numbers predate INH-001's Rotting Pier gate; C-082 landed, so attributes can now grow by 1 from three once-only encounters). Re-run tests/sim/early_inheritances.gd (seeds 1-10, 36 months) and refresh that section of docs/balance_baseline.txt; paste before/after per inheritance (passable, claimed, median month) in the commit body. If the curious policy never meets C-082's attribute encounters, say how many seeds explored the region long enough. Follow-ups: any inheritance still claimed by fewer than 3/10 seeds, with the blocking trial. No data changes. |
| QA-075 | qa | todo | The curious sim tries open chore fights (QA-070 Follow-up: deeds listed 12 times in 120 months, taken 0). In tests/sim/first_hour.gd's curious policy, when `Guidance.fair_fights` lists an entry of kind "deed" rated >= 0.7, travel to its place's region if needed and do the deed with the action the deed menu uses (grep GUIDE-026's deed path in Guidance and the deed_giver interactable). Re-run the fair-fights section (seeds 1-10, 12 months), refresh it in docs/balance_baseline.txt and paste the per-kind rows before/after. Follow-ups if deeds win more than 10 points below their rating. No data changes. |
| QA-045 | qa | todo spec | Why is the first Foundation year so gentle? (QA-039 Follow-up: 107/120 runs spent no artifact life, median win share 100%, 0 injuries; DESIGN.md's QA-007 target is ~60-85% against a foe of your own realm and stage.) *Spec:* extend the QA-039 sim (tests/sim/simulate_foundation_year.gd or wherever it landed) with `--threats=slip|fight` (default slip, today's behaviour). For seeds 1-10 and both policies print per region: encounters met, fights fought, fights evaded via sensed threats, the median stage reached by month 3/6/12, and a histogram of the rated odds (Combat sim helper the combat baseline uses) of every fight actually fought (<50%, 50-75%, 75-95%, >95%). Answer in the commit body, with numbers: (a) are fights rare or just easy? (b) do C-031's stage gates leave only foes the player has already outgrown by the time they appear? (c) does the player outgrow the region within months (stage climbs fast)? List under Follow-ups the 3 data changes you would make (enemy ids or gate stages), without making them. Add the `fight` run as its own tools/balance.sh section and refresh only that section. Keep it under ~60 s. |
| QA-042 | qa | todo spec | A "first Core Formation year" sim, like QA-039 one realm up (verifies C-031's Core gates). *Spec:* reuse QA-039's sim with the realm as an argument (`--realm=core_formation`): typical player at Core Formation Early with qi 0, rogue and sect variants, start in each region whose encounters include Core Formation fights (Myriad Peaks Ridge and any other; list them from data), 12 months of weekly explore + meditation + one mission a month, threats answered "slip away". Print per seed fights won/lost/evaded, injuries, lives spent (tribulation not included) and medians. Add to tools/balance.sh; loose guard: no artifact life spent in >= 8/10 seeds. If QA-045 has landed, include its `--threats` switch and odds histogram. |
| QA-035 | qa | todo | Economy sim: sect months every month (ECON-001b Follow-up). tests/sim/simulate_economy.gd only runs sect months every 12 months, so mission cooldowns never bind and sect income can't be compared fairly with profession work (still 1.5-1.9x for Doctor/Beast Tamer). Make the sim run the sect policy month by month (respecting `Sects.mission_cooldown_left`, duty, stipends) for a sect life, keep the same seeds, print per-profession "sect stones / work stones" ratios, update tools/balance.sh's baseline. If any profession's ratio is still > 1.5x, list the top 3 mission ids by net stones under Follow-ups (the planner files the content retune); don't retune data in this task. Also paste the economy section before/after ENC-003 (fading encounters; its commit skipped that comparison) and say whether income moved. Keep runtime under ~60 s. |

## Blocked (waiting on the owner, see DESIGN.md "Open design questions")
| id | role | status | task |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-005d | qa | blocked | Progression is far too fast (F-005c sim, seed 1, 200 lives): a sensible player (best reachable spot, Azure Cloud Sect) reaches Foundation at ~17, Core Formation at ~20, Nascent Soul at ~28, Void Refinement at ~92 and Tribulation Transcendence at ~800, with zero old-age deaths; Heavenly Roots hit Void Refinement at ~38. Even the bare density-1.0 sim reaches Core Formation at 40. Breakthrough pills never matter (no one can afford one before Foundation). Needs the target pacing from the owner (DESIGN.md open question), then rescale realms.json qi_required/base_qi_per_day and re-run `simulate_life.gd -- 200 1.0 1 real`. |
| C-009b | content | blocked | (LW-002b also found Qi Refining 3rd-5th layer players have low win odds in general.) Soften the first realm's fights so a newcomer with a starter technique wins ~50% against a 1st-layer beast (enemies.json `realm_training[1]` for stages 0-2, a starter beast between the bandit and the Mist Wolf, grade-1 gear at the Qingshi merchant). Blocked on the DESIGN.md question "(C-009) The first fights". QA-032 adds: a bare newcomer (no combat technique) wins 0% against wolves at stage 1; one option is a starter strike technique for every sect disciple. |
| END-001 | systems | blocked | An ending: at Tribulation Transcendence Peak a final Ascension tribulation, then an epilogue screen summing up the life (age, realm, alignment, deeds, clan, descendants). Blocked on the DESIGN.md question "(END-001) Ascension". |
| REL-006 | systems | blocked | Legacy after final death: offer "Continue as your heir" (Clans heir / designate_heir, game_state.gd ~1186) besides "Return to Main Menu". Blocked on the DESIGN.md question "Permadeath, or reincarnation / legacy system on death?". |
| SECT-001 | systems | blocked | Founding your own sect (roadmap item 3). Blocked on the DESIGN.md question "Founding your own sect". Default if approved: unlocks at Nascent Soul, needs a mountain-gate place, and reuses the clan treasury/buildings model (FAM-005/FAM-006) with disciples recruited from generated NPCs. |
| STORY-001 | content | blocked | Main story act 1 around the Creation Artifact (who made it, who hunts it). Blocked on the DESIGN.md question "Main story / Creation Artifact origin". Until answered, ART-006 keeps the origin vague. |
| DEM-002 | systems | blocked | Separate demonic progression tree (blood refining, soul devouring, corpse puppets) parallel to methods. Blocked on DESIGN.md question "Should evil paths include demonic cultivation techniques as a separate progression tree?". Default if approved: demonic methods via CM-001 + DEM-001 devouring, then a tree of unlockable demonic arts paid with "blood essence" gained from devouring. |
| ART-007 | systems | blocked | Artifact recharge cost curve: cost_growth 2.0 compounds over the whole life (life 10 costs 51,200, life 13 costs 409,600), so long-lived cultivators always run out (QA-006). Waiting on the DESIGN.md question "(QA-006) Artifact recharge cost"; default proposal: base_cost scales with realm and cost_growth applies only to lives bought within the current major realm. |
